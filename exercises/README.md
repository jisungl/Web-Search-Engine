We recommend that you keep the code for your exercises in this directory.
When you want to visit remote office hours to get help with an exercise,
if you push the code here in advance it will save time by allowing both
you and the TA to look at your code in Gitlab.

However, remember that exercises must be submitted for grading using
Gradescope.  Course staff will not look in this directory for exercise
solutions when grading exercises.
